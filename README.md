# Predicted-Diabetic-Patients-Re-Admission-
Predicted the possibility of hospital readmission of a diabetic patient.

# Goal:
The purpose of this project is to predict the possibility of hospital readmission of a diabetic patient.
A hospital readmission is when a patient is discharged from the hospital and get readmitted in
certain period of a time for a similar diagnosis. Hospital readmission for certain digit is considered
to be the measure of the quality of hospitals. So to regulate this, prediction of hospital readmission
will help to take appropriate measures in medication. The hospital readmission is predicted based
on other factors in a dataset.

# INTRODUCTION
A hospital readmission is when a patient who is discharged from the hospital, gets re admitted again within a certain period of time. Hospital readmission rates are considered as an indicator of hospital quality. In 2011, American hospitals spent over $41 billion on diabetic patients who got readmitted within 30 days of discharge

# Dataset:
For this project, the dataset is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is publicly available to download from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008 (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)
The dataset consist of 50 features and 101766 records. The target variable has 3 classes and this is the multi-class classification problem.
